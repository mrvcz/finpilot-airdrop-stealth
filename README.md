## 💡 About Finpilot

Finpilot is an AI-driven personal finance assistant integrating Web2 and Web3 signals to help users save smarter, spend wiser, and stay ahead of economic shifts — including real-time alerts on commodities, crypto, and DeFi.

We are now building on Solana, and this stealth airdrop is your early entry.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User enters their **Solana wallet address**
2. (Optionally) enters email for updates
3. Their wallet is saved to a **snapshot list**
4. Future eligibility for $FIN token airdrop depends on participation, engagement and DAO votes
